## 🔍 What's Tested

### Critical Paths:

- ✅ Authentication flow (login, password recovery, admin reset)
- ✅ File encryption/decryption
- ✅ File upload/download with versioning
- ✅ File sharing and permissions
- ✅ Session management and expiration
- ✅ Audit logging (all event types)
- ✅ Automated backups

### Edge Cases:

- ✅ Invalid inputs (non-existent users, files, tokens)
- ✅ Expired tokens and sessions
- ✅ Permission denials
- ✅ Database errors
- ✅ File errors (missing, corrupt, too large)
- ✅ Empty and binary files

### Security:

- ✅ Password strength validation
- ✅ Token expiration
- ✅ Account lockout
- ✅ Permission checks
- ✅ Audit trail verification

---

## ✅ Next Steps

1. **Run tests** to verify all pass:

    ```bash
    pytest tests/ --cov=app --cov-fail-under=95
    ```

2. **Fix any failing tests** (if any)

3. **Review coverage report** to identify any remaining gaps

4. **Add any missing edge cases** if coverage is still below 95%

5. **Update CI/CD** to enforce 95% coverage threshold

---

## 📋 Notes

- All tests follow pytest conventions
- Tests use fixtures from `conftest.py` for consistency
- Tests are isolated (use temporary directories, mock databases)
- Tests cover both success and failure paths
- Integration tests verify end-to-end workflows
- All critical security paths are tested

**Status:** ✅ Comprehensive test suite complete - Ready for verification
