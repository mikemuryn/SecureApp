## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### "Authentication failed"

- Check your username and password
- Ensure caps lock is off
- Contact admin if account is locked (too many failed attempts)

### "File not found"

- The file may have been deleted
- Check you have permission to access the file
- Verify the file ID is correct (CLI)

### "Access denied"

- You don't have permission for this file
- Contact the file owner to share it with you
- Admin users have access to all files

### Application won't start

- Check Python version (3.8+ required)
- Verify all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Check logs in `logs/SecureApp.log`

### Files upload slowly

- Large files take longer to encrypt
- Check available disk space
- Ensure no other processes are using the database

## üí° Best Practices

### Security

1. **Use Strong Passwords**
    - Minimum 8 characters
    - Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
    - Don't reuse passwords

2. **Change Default Password**
    - Change the admin password immediately
    - Regularly update passwords

3. **Limit Admin Access**
    - Only grant admin role to trusted users
    - Regular users should have "user" role

4. **Regular Backups**
    - Create backups regularly
    - Store backups in a secure location
    - Test backup restoration

5. **Audit Logs**
    - Review audit logs regularly
    - Look for suspicious activity
    - Monitor failed login attempts

### File Management

1. **Use Tags**
    - Tag files for easy organization
    - Use consistent tagging conventions
    - Color-code by category

2. **Version Control**
    - Upload new versions instead of deleting old files
    - Add notes when creating versions
    - Review version history periodically

3. **File Sharing**
    - Share only with trusted users
    - Use "Read" permission when possible
    - Revoke access when no longer needed

4. **Search and Filter**
    - Use search to find files quickly
    - Clear search to see all files
    - Use tags in combination with search

### Performance

1. **Large File Sets**
    - Use search to filter files
    - The UI limits display to 1000 files for performance
    - Use CLI for bulk operations

2. **Regular Cleanup**
    - Delete old/unused files
    - Archive old versions if needed
    - Keep database size manageable
